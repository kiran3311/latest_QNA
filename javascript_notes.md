## 🔹 Difference Between **Synchronous** and **Asynchronous**

### **1. Synchronous (Blocking)**

* Tasks are executed **one after another** in sequence.
* A task must **finish before the next one starts**.
* If one task takes time, it **blocks** the execution of others.

✅ Example:

```javascript
console.log("Start");

function longTask() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 1e9; i++) {} // heavy loop
  console.log("Task Done");
}

longTask();
console.log("End");
```

👉 Output:

```
Start
Task Done
End
```

Notice: "End" is printed only after the heavy task completes.

---

### **2. Asynchronous (Non-Blocking)**

* Tasks are executed **independently**, without waiting for others.
* JavaScript delegates async tasks (like API calls, timers, file reads) to the **browser/Web APIs**, which handle them in the background.
* Results are returned via **callbacks, Promises, or async/await**.

✅ Example:

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Async Task Done");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
```

👉 Output:

```
Start
End
Async Task Done
```

Notice: "End" prints before the async task finishes.

---

## 🔹 Default Behaviour of JavaScript

* JavaScript is **synchronous** and **single-threaded** by default.
* But it can perform **asynchronous operations** using the **event loop** and **Web APIs** (e.g., `setTimeout`, Fetch API, promises).

👉 So in short:

* **By default → synchronous single-threaded.**
* **But** it uses an event loop to handle async tasks, making it *non-blocking* in practice.

---

## 🎯 Interview Answer (Short & Crisp)

> *“JavaScript is single-threaded and synchronous by default, meaning it executes one statement at a time in order. However, for time-consuming operations, JavaScript uses asynchronous behavior via the event loop and Web APIs. This prevents blocking and allows tasks like API calls or timers to run in the background while the main thread continues execution.”*

## 1. Callback
- A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function, executed after an operation completes. While it works, nested callbacks can create callback hell, making the code difficult to read and maintain.
- A function passed as an argument to another function, to be executed later when the task is done.
- Used for asynchronous operations like reading files, making API call
```js
function fetchData(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    callback("Data received");
  }, 2000);
}

fetchData((result) => {
  console.log(result); // "Data received"
});
```

- Problem ❌
  if chain multiple task then may caused callback hell (nasted unreadable code)
  
```js
task1(() => {
  task2(() => {
    task3(() => {
      console.log("Done!");
    });
  });
});

```

---

## 2 Promises
- A Promise is a special JavaScript object that represents the result of an asynchronous operation. It provides a cleaner way to handle async tasks by chaining .then() for success and .catch() for errors, instead of deeply nested callbacks.
- A special JavaScript object representing the result of an async operation.
- Can be in one of 3 states:
  - pending → initial state
  -  fulfilled → operation successful (.then)
  -  rejected → operation failed (.catch)
 
 ✅ Example (Promise):

```javascript
function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Data received");
    }, 2000);
  });
}

fetchData()
  .then((result) => console.log(result))  // success
  .catch((error) => console.error(error)); // failure
```

✅ Promise chaining (cleaner than nested callbacks):

```javascript
fetchData()
  .then((res) => res + " -> processed")
  .then((res) => console.log(res));
```

## 3 async/await
* `async/await` is **syntactic sugar** built on top of **Promises**.
* It makes asynchronous code look and behave like **synchronous code**, improving **readability** and **maintainability**.
* Introduced in **ES8 (ECMAScript 2017)**.



#### 🔹 How it Works

1. A function declared with `async` always returns a **Promise**.
2. Inside an `async` function, you can use `await` to **pause execution** until the Promise is resolved or rejected.
3. While the function is "paused," other code continues to execute (non-blocking).

####  Example Using `async/await`:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const result = await getData();
    console.log(result); // "Data received"
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}

fetchData();
```

👉 Output:

```
Data received
```

#### 🔹 Interview Answer (Short & Crisp)

> *“`async/await` is a cleaner way to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript. It’s built on top of Promises and makes async code look synchronous. The `async` keyword ensures a function returns a Promise, and the `await` keyword pauses execution until the Promise resolves or rejects. This helps avoid callback hell and makes code easier to read and maintain.”*

## 4 Callback Hell
“Callback hell happens when we nest too many callbacks. We can handle it by modularizing functions, using Promises with .then(), or better, using async/await which makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain. Utility libraries like async.js can also help.”
**Callback Hell** = deeply nested callbacks, hard to read/maintain/debug.
Example of **Callback Hell**:

```javascript
doTask1((result1) => {
  doTask2(result1, (result2) => {
    doTask3(result2, (result3) => {
      doTask4(result3, (result4) => {
        console.log("All tasks done:", result4);
      });
    });
  });
});
```

---

####  ✅ Ways to Handle Callback Hell

#### 1. **Modularize Functions**

Break callbacks into **named functions** instead of anonymous ones.

```javascript
function step1(result) {
  doTask2(result, step2);
}
function step2(result) {
  doTask3(result, step3);
}
function step3(result) {
  doTask4(result, (final) => console.log("Done:", final));
}

doTask1(step1);
```

👉 Cleaner, but still a callback style.

---

#### 2. **Use Promises**

Convert callbacks into **Promises** for chaining.

```javascript
doTask1()
  .then(doTask2)
  .then(doTask3)
  .then(doTask4)
  .then((final) => console.log("Done:", final))
  .catch((err) => console.error(err));
```

---

#### 3. **Use Async/Await**

`async/await` makes async code look like synchronous code.

```javascript
async function runTasks() {
  try {
    const result1 = await doTask1();
    const result2 = await doTask2(result1);
    const result3 = await doTask3(result2);
    const result4 = await doTask4(result3);
    console.log("Done:", result4);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
}

runTasks();
```

---

#### 4. **Use Utility Libraries (like `async.js`)**

Libraries like `async.js` help control flow (`series`, `parallel`, `waterfall`).

```javascript
async.waterfall([
  doTask1,
  doTask2,
  doTask3,
  doTask4
], (err, result) => {
  if (err) console.error(err);
  else console.log("Done:", result);
});
```

# 🔹 Difference Between Callback, Promise, and Async/Await

| Feature               | **Callback**                                                          | **Promise**                                                             | **Async/Await**                                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**        | A function passed as an argument to another function, executed later. | An object representing eventual completion or failure of an async task. | Syntactic sugar over Promises, makes async code look synchronous. |
| **Syntax Complexity** | Can lead to **callback hell** (nested functions).                     | Cleaner chaining with `.then()` and `.catch()`.                         | Easiest to read & write, looks like synchronous code.             |
| **Error Handling**    | Must handle errors inside callback manually.                          | Errors handled using `.catch()`.                                        | Errors handled with `try...catch`.                                |
| **Readability**       | Hard to read with multiple async tasks.                               | Easier than callbacks but chaining can get long.                        | Very clean and readable.                                          |
| **Execution**         | Executes when the parent function calls it.                           | Executes when promise resolves or rejects.                              | Waits for promise to resolve/reject before continuing.            |
| **Introduced In**     | Core JavaScript (early days).                                         | ES6 (2015).                                                             | ES8 (2017).                                                       |

getData()
  .then((result) => console.log(result))
  .catch((err) => console.error(err));
```

---

### 3. Async/Await
